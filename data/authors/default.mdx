I am a software engineer with nearly three years of professional experience, including a stint as a DevOps engineer, I possess a versatile skill set rooted in the JavaScript stack with occasional forays into Python.My journey in software engineering has been marked by an unwavering commitment to quality code, efficient problem-solving, and seamless collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.

With a dual expertise in both development and operations, I've honed the ability to streamline deployment processes, enhance system reliability, and optimize software performance. My experience spans the full software development lifecycle, making me a valuable asset to any team seeking a well-rounded engineer with a strong focus on results and continuous improvement.
